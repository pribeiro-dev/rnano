# Contributing to rnano

Thanks for your interest! rnano aims to be a small, reliable TUI editor. Please:

1. **Discuss first**: open an Issue for new features or behavior changes.
2. **Small PRs**: keep changes focused; add tests when applicable.
3. **Style**: rustfmt + clippy defaults; keep dependencies lean.
4. **Platforms**: Linux/macOS/Windows. Avoid breaking Windows console support.
5. **Performance**: measure before/after for hotspots (render & input loop).

## Development (later)
Rust setup and commands will be documented when code is added.

## Reporting bugs
Use *Bug report* template. Include: OS, terminal, steps, expected/actual, and logs (if `RUST_LOG` was enabled).
