# rnano (working title)

A minimal, fast, cross‑platform TUI text editor inspired by **nano**. Goals: instant startup, reliable saves, correct Unicode, and zero external deps beyond the terminal. **No code yet** — this repo currently contains planning, issues, and CI skeleton.

## Roadmap & Milestones
- **M1 — MVP:** open/edit/save, basic navigation, status bar, prompts, safe writes.
- **M2 — QoL:** incremental search, undo/redo, soft‑wrap, line numbers, config, help.
- **M3 — Robustez:** encodings, autosave/swap, large files, long lines, performance.
- **M4 — Syntax:** light highlighting & themes, fast startup preserved.
- **M5 — Ergonomia:** clipboard, mouse, multiple buffers, macros, on‑save hooks.

## Build status
CI is dormant until Rust code lands.
